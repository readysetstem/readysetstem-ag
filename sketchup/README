Importing from Inkscape:
    - Inkscape:
        - Design must be converted to paths: Select all; Path -> Object to Path
        - File - > Save a Copy
            - Type DXF
            - Deselect "use ROBOT-Master ..." if selected.
            - Deselect "use LWPOLYLINE..." if selected.  (Important!)
            - Base unit: in.
    - Sketchup
        - Import...   Select DXF
        - Select part and explode
        - Will likely need to edit at 1000 scale, and then scale back, for better precision.
        - Will need to redraw lines on part to restore faces.
Note on the Text Tool:
    - The Text Tool (Text with Arrow Leader), sometimes loses the text when the
      Leader is "View based", when the image is exported.  To fix this, Leave
      the Leader as "Pushpin".
    - Whenever you move the text around, or reorient the scene camera, you must:
        - Move the text
        - Change the Leader to View based
        - Change the Leader to Pushpin
Exporting sketchup images for users guide:
    - Orient Scene to Main (double click on "Main" just below toolbar)
